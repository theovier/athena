# Athena

This is a 2D shoot'em up game done in [KTX](https://github.com/libktx/ktx). 
After having worked with some state-of-the-art engines like Unity and Unreal, I decided to toy around with a more old-school approach to making games. 
The main purpose of this project is simply to play around with some ideas and homemade graphics. 
Don't expect anything too fancy or polished here.
